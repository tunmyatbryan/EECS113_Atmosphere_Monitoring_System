# EECS113_Atmosphere_Monitoring_System

In this project the team developed a Raspberry Pi based IoT device to implement a weather Monitoring System.
The data from this monitoring system will be used to decide on how much water to be needed to irrigate and to “turn on” a virtual sprinkler system. 
The whole project included introduction of the Evapotranspiration (ET) concept, integration of how to compute the amount of water needed to irrigation using ET 
and how to get the irrigation and weather data from the CIMIS system. 
The system will simulate irrigation once per hour by turning on a relay and then turning it off after the amount of time needed to deliver the requisite amount of water.
